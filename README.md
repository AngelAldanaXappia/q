## Roadmap

This library is being initially developed for one of my internal project,
so API methods will likely be implemented in the order that they are
needed by my project. Eventually, I would like to cover the entire
SOQL and SOSL query language, so contributions are of course
[always welcome][contributing]. Adding new methods is relatively
straightforward, so feel free to join the fun!
